# sonar:bit 

## Introduction
---

Sonar:bit is an ultrasonic module with 3-5V working voltage. It is available to be used to 3.3V or 5V micro-controller system. With only one 3-wire(GVS) cable, it can work properly. Compared to the normal 4-wire ultrasonic module, it has saved one IO port. The measurement range of sonar:bit is 4cm-400cm. It can output stable and accurate measurement data with Â±1cm tolerance only. You can use this module to occasions like short-distance measurement, smart cars, robots, micro:bit and arduino teaching, etc..

## Quick Start
---

### Hardware Connection  

Connect sonar:bit to P2 port on sensor:bit and connect micro:bit to your computer.  
Once completed, you can see the picture below:

### Programming

Click to open [Makecode](https://makecode.microbit.org/) online editor.

Write your program to assign the returned value of P2 to variable distance and display it on micro:bit screen.
