Note: If you met a tip indicating that the codebase will be deleted due to incompatibility, you may continue as the tips say or build a new project in the menu. 

### Step 2

You may also downoad it directly below: 

<div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:70%;overflow:hidden;"><iframe style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" src="https://makecode.microbit.org/#pub:_RXyWcdDkYWm3" frameborder="0" sandbox="allow-popups allow-forms allow-scripts allow-same-origin"></iframe></div>

### Result
- The red and green LEDs light on at random, press button A while the red lights on; press button B while the green lights on, if you press them at the right sequence(A for red and B for green ), the micro:bit display a "√" or it displays a sad face.
