## FAQ
---
**Fail to connect Scratch**

1. The lowest operation system version is listed at the top of this page.
2. Only one copy of the scratch can be connected to the micro:bit. If you have open the Scratch in other browsers, please close all of them and re-try. 
3. If there is another computer connecting to your micro:bit, please cut off the connection with another computer or yours, and re-try.
4. You might press the "reset" button between the USB connector and power supply connector on the back of the micro:bit while operating it, make sure your hands or feet be away from it!
