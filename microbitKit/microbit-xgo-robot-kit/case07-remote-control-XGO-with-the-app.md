## Control
There are four ways to control the XGO which include the **performance mode**, the **overall mode**, the **single-leg control** and the **servo control**. 

The  **performance mode** has all the preset commands which could control xgo with a low DOFs and a high operability.

The **overall mode** is able to control the speed and directions with a high DOFs and senstive operation.

Both the **single-leg control** and the **servo control** are able to control small granularity, they are able to control a single leg(the left front leg, the right front leg, the right hind leg and the left hind leg) and the top, middle and bottom servos. And they are also for a tiny adjustment for some spcial actions.
