## Connection Type: RJ11 to Dupont connector

While the micro:bit breakout board doesn't have the RJ11 connections, we can choose to use a Dupont wire that has the RJ11 connections. We need to connect the RJ11 to the Lens and the other ends connect to the breakout board(Black wire to GND;Red to VCC;Green to P19(SDA);Yellow to P20(SCL)). If the Lens doesn't work from the start, please try powering it with a standalone power sourse.
